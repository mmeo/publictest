    ## Introduction

    ### API Integration

    Chargify can be integrated with many environments and programming languages via our REST API. Some of our users have contributed their API wrappers in various programming languages. Check out the [API Code Overview](https://developers.chargify.com/docs/developer-docs/ZG9jOjE0NjAzNDI2-api-code-samples) doc for an introduction to the wrappers and available code samples.

    ### Testing Guide

    Chargify has compiled a [testing guide](https://chargify.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4407904658587) that covers a list of important factors to consider while in the testing phase. Here's a high-level overiew of what's covered in our testing guide:

    + Test credit card basics
    + Test site limits
    + Live mode versus test mode

    We strongly suggest reading over the testing guide, as well as the entire set of application-based documentation to aid in your discovery of the product.

    ### Engage Support

    We always enjoy (and appreciate) hearing about larger integrations ahead of time. If you’re planning on importing a large amount of data into Chargify via our API, we suggest sending a “heads up” to “support@chargify.com” so we can coordinate with you to ensure your import process goes smoothly.

    Our API, while considered stable, is continually being improved and polished. Please feel free to contact support if you experience issues when integrating with the Chargify API.

    ### Support Access

    Access to our Technical Specialist team for API support is currently limited to purchasers of our larger Chargify support plans.

    ## API Overview

    The Chargify API allows you to interact with our system programmatically from your own application. Using the API you interact with Resources such as:

    - Products
    - Subscriptions
    - Customers
    - etc.

    The API attempts to conform to the [RESTful](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer) design principles.
    You interact with the resources exposed via the API by accessing resource collection and element URIs using the HTTP verbs (GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE).
    Chargify accepts and returns both JSON and XML data via the API.

    You’ll likely need access to a web developer or programmer (if you’re not one) to get the most use out of the API.

    ### Available Formats: JSON and XML

    JSON is the primary and recommended format for use with the Chargify API.  XML is also provided as a backwards compatible option for Merchants who require it.

    ### Authentication

    Authentication is implemented as HTTP Basic Authentication over TLS >= 1.2 (HTTPS), as described in [API Authentication](https://developers.chargify.com/docs/developer-docs/ZG9jOjE1NTUxNQ-authentication)

    ### URL

    The URL for API requests includes the subdomain of the Site you are working with:

    `https://<subdomain>.chargify.com/<resource URI>`

    ### Response Data

    Response data is sent as either XML or JSON, depending on the type of data requested (`HTTP Content-Type` header) or the type specified as being accepted (HTTP `Accept` header).

    GETs for individual statements & invoices may also be requested as PDF using `application/pdf` or appending `.pdf` to the resource URI.

    Response codes are sent via the normal HTTP Response Code, and are documented separately for each resource.

    For boolean fields, please note that a value of `null` may be considered as false. However, this is not true across all cases. Please excercise good judgement here, or contact support with any questions.

    For example:

    + `null` can define that there's no data available for that attribute

    ### Pagination

    When an endpoint returns a list of items, it will be paginated.  Usually, 20 items will be returned by default, and you may request up to a maximum of 200 at a time.  Pagination is done with query string parameters, for example: `?page=5&per_page=200`

    ### Response Time Zones

    API responses from Chargify are sent with the timezone of current Chargify site.

    Alternately, webhooks sent from Chargify globally utilize EST as the timezone for all content in the body of the payload.

    ### Request Data

    POST and PUT request data may be formatted as either XML (`application/xml`) or JSON (`application/json`). For best results, you should set your HTTP `Content-Type` request header accordingly, although you may also specify your format by appending `.xml` or `.json` extensions on to the resource URI.

    Note that Chargify does not accept PUT or POST data sent as query params or form encoded data – data must be sent as either XML or JSON. If you fail to set your `Content-Type` to either `application/xml` or `application/json`, your request may fail due to triggering of forgery protection mechanisms.

    #### About Decimal Numbers

    In order to prevent losing precision, we serialize decimal numbers as strings instead of as JSON numbers.

    We recommend parsing these strings into their decimal equivalent using a decimal number library in your programming language (i.e. `BigDecimal` in Ruby) instead of relying on floating point values or arithmetic.

    #### About Amount Fields

    Fields holding amount values are given as a string representing a decimal whole currency amount.

    For example, `"1.23"` in currency `"USD"` would equate to `$1.23`.

    Not all fields will be rounded to the smallest currency denomination.  Intermediate results, such as those that derive from line-level tax calculations, may hold precision up to 8 decimal places.  However, the top-level totals we provide (e.g. `total_amount`) will be rounded to the smallest currency denomination.

    It is up to API consumers to parse the string into a decimal number representation and do any rounding necessary for your application.

    ### Debugging

    If you’re having difficulty executing a request via our API, try the simplest thing and attempt your request via the curl command-line tool, as shown in the below example. Add the `--verbose` flag to your request to receive even more debugging information.

    Another handy tool is [Beeceptor](https://beeceptor.com/). You can use this to intercept your request to see exactly what is being sent.

    If you are unable to connect at all, check that you are using TLS 1.2 or better.

    If you see a "Could not resolve host" error, double check that the url is correct, including your subdomain. For example: `mysite.chargify.com`.  This error means your DNS server could not find an IP address for the domain you are trying to connect to.

    ### Backwards Compatibility

    We consider the following changes to be backwards compatible and may make them without advance notice:

    + Adding new API endpoints, or adding new attributes in the responses of existing endpoints
    + Adding new optional parameters to be sent to existing API endpoints
    + Adding new fields to exported data
    + Changing the type or length of any of the ID attributes
      + For example, most IDs are currently integers, but you should not assume that this will always be the case.

    In addition, you should not depend on the order of attributes within the API response as this may change.

    Chargify does not provide notifications for additions that are clearly defined as backwards compatible.

    ### Examples

    The following examples use the curl command-line tool to execute API requests.

    #### Subscription Listing

    **Request**

        curl -u <api_key>:x -H Accept:application/json -H Content-Type:application/json https://acme.chargify.com/subscriptions.json


    ## API Access Limitations

    There are a few scenarios that may end up in causing an API request to be blocked even with correct credentials.
    **Please note:** All relevant API requests will be blocked if any of the below conditions are true. These limitations also apply to [Chargify Direct](https://developers.chargify.com/docs/developer-docs/ZG9jOjE0NjAzNDE3-introduction).

    Those scenarios are as follows:

    - Your Chargify subscription is canceled.
    - Your Chargify trial has reached an end.
    - The site you're making a request for is in the process of ["clearing site data"](https://chargify.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4407864367387)
      - _Note: any API request for another site that is in a good state will NOT be blocked_
    - The site you're making a request for has been deleted.
      - _Note: any API request for another site that is in a good state will NOT be blocked_

    Read more about your Chargify subscription [here](https://chargify.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4407747017115)

    ### What happens when an API request is blocked

    The request will fail with a `422` http status code. The response will also include a message explaining the reason for the request being blocked. For example:

    - If your Chargify subscription is canceled:

    ```json
    {
      "errors" => [
        [0] "Your Chargify account has been canceled. Please contact support@chargify.com to reactivate."
      ]
    }
    ```

    - If your Chargify trial has reached and end and you attempted to make an API request, the response body will look like:

    ```json
    {
      "errors" => [
        [0] "Your trial has ended, please contact sales."
      ]
    }
    ```

    - If the site you're making a request for is in the process of ["clearing site data"](https://chargify.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4407864367387):

    ```json
    {
      "errors" => [
        [0] "Site data clearing is in progress. Please try later."
      ]
    }
    ```

    - If the site you're making a request for has been deleted:

    ```json
    {
      "errors" => [
        [0] "This site has been deleted."
      ]
    }
    ```

    ## Secure Applications

    Please note that it is NOT possible to make API requests directly from the customer's browser or device.  Doing so would expose your API key on the client side, and anyone who has that key has full access to all of your Chargify data.

    Instead you will need to take care to tokenize sensitive information by using [Chargify.js](https://developers.chargify.com/docs/developer-docs/ZG9jOjE0NjAzNDI0-overview) or a similar JavaScript library provided by your gateway, and then post the token and other information to your own server, from which you can make the API call to Chargify.

    #### Troubleshooting

    If you attempt to make a Chargify API request directly from the customer's browser, you may see an error such as:

    ```
    Response to preflight request doesn't pass access control check: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource.
    ```

    or

    ```
    Origin 'https://example.com' is therefore not allowed access.` `The response had HTTP status code 404.
    ```

    This is an error message indicating that Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is not enabled on the Chargify server.

    ## Relationship Invoicing

    ### API Compatibility for Relationship Invoicing

    This section describes the API for the new, [Relationship Invoicing](https://chargify.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4407737494171) style of invoices introduced in January 2018.

    If you are an existing customer from prior to January 2018 or have not otherwise explicitly opted into this new style of invoices, you are probably looking for the legacy "Invoices" section that describes [invoice-billing legacy-style invoices](./b3A6MTQxMDgzNjQ-read-invoice).

    These new invoices provide a single representation of all of your Chargify billing, whether you collect automatically or via remittance.

    ### About Decimal Numbers

    In order to prevent losing precision, we serialize decimal numbers as strings instead of as JSON numbers.

    We recommend parsing these strings into their decimal equivalent using a decimal number library in your programming language (i.e. `BigDecimal` in Ruby) instead of relying on floating point values or arithmetic.

    ### About Amount Fields

    Fields holding amount values are given as a string representing a decimal whole currency amount.

    For example, `"1.23"` in currency `"USD"` would equate to `$1.23`.

    Not all fields will be rounded to the smallest currency denomination. Intermediate results, such as those that derive from line-level tax calculations, may hold precision up to 8 decimal places.  However, the top-level totals we provide (e.g. `total_amount`) will be rounded to the smallest currency denomination.

    It is up to API consumers to parse the string into a decimal number representation and do any rounding necessary for your application.

    #### Relationship Invoicing Summary

    + If your site **is** using relationship invoicing, you may only use the methods described in this section for working with invoices.

    + If your site is **not** using relationship invoicing, please use the legacy invoice methods:

      + [Invoices](./b3A6MTQxMTA0MTA-read-invoice)
      + [Invoices: Payments](./b3A6MTQxMTA0MTI-create-invoice-payment)
      + [Invoices: Charges](./b3A6MTQxMTA0MTM-create-charge)
      + [Invoices: Credits](./b3A6MTQxMTA0MTQ-create-invoice-credit)

        ## Webhooks Intro

        The Webhooks API allows you to view a list of all webhooks and to selectively resend individual or groups of webhooks. Webhooks will be sent on endpoints specified by you. Endpoints can be added via API or Web UI. There is also an option to enable / disable webhooks via API request.

        We recommend that you review Chargify's webhook documentation located in our help site. The following resources will help guide you on how to use webhooks in Chargify, in addition to these webhook endpoints:

        You can update an Endpoint via the API with a PUT request to the resource endpoint.

        You can change the `url` of your endpoint which consumes webhooks or list of `webhook_subscriptions`.
        Check available [Event keys](https://chargify.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4407905415963).

        Always send a complete list of events which you want subscribe/watch.
        Sending an PUT request for existing endpoint with empty list of `webhook_subscriptions` will end with unsubscribe from all events.

        If you want unsubscribe from specific event, just send a list of `webhook_subscriptions` without the specific event key.

        ## How to Use Subscription Notes

        Notes allow you to record information about a particular Subscription in a free text format.

        If you have structured data such as birth date, color, etc., consider using Metadata instead.

        You may create a new Customer at any time, or you may create a Customer at the same time you create a Subscription. The only validation restriction is that you may only create one customer for a given reference value.

        If provided, the `reference` value must be unique. It represents a unique identifier for the customer from your own app, i.e. the customer’s ID. This allows you to retrieve a given customer via a piece of shared information. Alternatively, you may choose to leave `reference` blank, and store Chargify’s unique ID for the customer, which is in the `id` attribute.

        Full documentation on how to locate, create and edit Customers in the Chargify UI can be located [here](https://chargify.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4407659914267).

        ## Required Country Format

        Chargify requires that you use the ISO Standard Country codes when formatting country attribute of the customer.

        Countries should be formatted as 2 characters. For more information, please see the following wikipedia article on [ISO_3166-1.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1#Current_codes)

        ## Required State Format

        Chargify requires that you use the ISO Standard State codes when formatting state attribute of the customer.

        + US States (2 characters): [ISO_3166-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-2:US)

        + States Outside the US (2-3 characters): To find the correct state codes outside of the US, please go to [ISO_3166-1](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1#Current_codes) and click on the link in the “ISO 3166-2 codes” column next to country you wish to populate.

        ## Locale

        Chargify allows you to attribute a language/region to your customer to deliver invoices in any required language.

        ## Billing Portal Documentation

        Full documentation on how the Billing Portal operates within the Chargify UI can be located [here](https://chargify.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4407648972443).

        This documentation is focused on how the to configure the Billing Portal Settings, as well as Subscriber Interaction and Merchant Management of the Billing Portal.

        You can use this endpoint to enable Billing Portal access for a Customer, with the option of sending the Customer an Invitation email at the same time.

        ## Billing Portal Security

        If your customer has been invited to the Billing Portal, then they will receive a link to manage their subscription (the “Management URL”) automatically at the bottom of their statements, invoices, and receipts. **This link changes periodically for security and is only valid for 65 days.**

        If you need to provide your customer their Management URL through other means, you can retrieve it via the API. Because the URL is cryptographically signed with a timestamp, it is not possible for merchants to generate the URL without requesting it from Chargify.

        In order to prevent abuse & overuse, we ask that you request a new URL only when absolutely necessary. Management URLs are good for 65 days, so you should re-use a previously generated one as much as possible. If you use the URL frequently (such as to display on your website), please **do not** make an API request to Chargify every time.

        ## Rules for Management Link API

        + When retrieving a management URL, multiple requests for the same customer in a short period will return the **same** URL
        + We will not generate a new URL for 15 days
        + You must cache and remember this URL if you are going to need it again within 15 days
        + Only request a new URL after the `new_link_available_at` date
        + You are limited to 15 requests for the same URL. If you make more than 15 requests before `new_link_available_at`, you will be blocked from further Management URL requests (with a response code `429`)

        # Reason Codes Intro

        ReasonCodes are a way to gain a high level view of why your customers are cancelling the subcription to your product or service.

        Add a set of churn reason codes to be displayed in-app and/or the Chargify Billing Portal. As your subscribers decide to cancel their subscription, learn why they decided to cancel.

        ## Custom Fields: Metafield Intro

        **Chargify refers to Custom Fields in the API documentation as metafields and metadata.** Within the Chargify UI, metadata and metafields are grouped together under the umbrella of "Custom Fields." All of our UI-based documentation that references custom fields will not cite the terminology metafields or metadata.

        + **Metafield is the custom field**
        + **Metadata is the data populating the custom field.**

        Chargify Metafields are used to add meaningful attributes to subscription and customer resources. Full documentation on how to create Custom Fields in the Chargify UI can be located [here](https://chargify.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4407659856411). For additional documentation on how to record data within custom fields, please see our subscription-based documentation [here.](https://chargify.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4407884887835#customer-details)

        Metafield are the place where you will set up your resource to accept additional data. It is scoped to the site instead of a specific customer or subscription. Think of it as the key, and Metadata as the value on every record.

        ## Create Metafields

        Use this endpoint to create metafields for your Site. Metafields can be populated with metadata after the fact.

        Each site is limited to 100 unique Metafields (i.e. keys, or names) per resource. This means you can have 100 Metafields for Subscription and another 100 for Customer.

        ### Metafields "On-the-Fly"

        It is possible to create Metafields “on the fly” when you create your Metadata – if a non-existant name is passed when creating Metadata, a Metafield for that key will be automatically created. The Metafield API, however, gives you more control over your “keys”.

        ### Metafield Scope Warning

        If configuring metafields in the Admin UI or via the API, be careful sending updates to metafields with the scope attribute – **if a partial update is sent it will overwrite the current configuration**.

        ## Custom Fields: Metadata Intro

        **Chargify refers to Custom Fields in the API documentation as metafields and metadata.** Within the Chargify UI, metadata and metafields are grouped together under the umbrella of "Custom Fields." All of our UI-based documentation that references custom fields will not cite the terminology metafields or metadata.

        + **Metafield is the custom field**
        + **Metadata is the data populating the custom field.**

        Chargify Metafields are used to add meaningful attributes to subscription and customer resources. Full documentation on how to create Custom Fields in the Chargify UI can be located [here](https://chargify.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4407659856411). For additional documentation on how to record data within custom fields, please see our subscription-based documentation [here.](https://chargify.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4407884887835#custom-fields)

        Metadata is associated to a customer or subscription, and corresponds to a Metafield. When creating a new metadata object for a given record, **if the metafield is not present it will be created**.

        ## Metadata limits

        Metadata values are limited to 2kB in size. Additonally, there are limits on the number of unique metafields available per resource.

        ## Create Metadata

        This method will create a metafield for the site on the fly if it does not already exist, and populate the metadata value.

        ### Subscription or Customer Resource

        Please pay special attention to the resource you use when creating metadata.

        ## Coupons Documentation

        Coupons can be administered in the Chargify application or created via API. Please view our section on [creating coupons](https://chargify.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4407755909531) for more information.

        Additionally, for documentation on how to apply a coupon to a subscription within the Chargify UI, please see our documentation [here](https://chargify.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4407884887835#coupon).

        ## Create Coupon

        This request will create a coupon, based on the provided information.

        When creating a coupon, you must specify a product family using the `product_family_id`. If no `product_family_id` is passed, the first product family available is used. You will also need to formulate your URL to cite the Product Family ID in your request.

        You can restrict a coupon to only apply to specific products / components by optionally passing in hashes of `restricted_products` and/or `restricted_components` in the format:
        `{ "<product/component_id>": boolean_value }`

        You can retrieve the Coupon via the API with the Show method. You must identify the Coupon in this call by the ID parameter that Chargify assigns.
        If instead you would like to find a Coupon using a Coupon code, see the Coupon Find method.

        When fetching a coupon, if you have defined multiple currencies at the site level, you can optionally pass the `?currency_prices=true` query param to include an array of currency price data in the response.

        If the coupon is set to `use_site_exchange_rate: true`, it will return pricing based on the current exchange rate. If the flag is set to false, it will return all of the defined prices for each currency.

        ## Update Coupon

        You can update a Coupon via the API with a PUT request to the resource endpoint.

        You can restrict a coupon to only apply to specific products / components by optionally passing in hashes of `restricted_products` and/or `restricted_components` in the format:
        `{ "<product/component_id>": boolean_value }`

        You can archive a Coupon via the API with the archive method.
        Archiving makes that Coupon unavailable for future use, but allows it to remain attached and functional on existing Subscriptions that are using it.
        The `archived_at` date and time will be assigned.

        You can verify if a specific coupon code is valid using the `validate` method. This method is useful for validating coupon codes that are entered by a customer. If the coupon is found and is valid, the coupon will be returned with a 200 status code.

        If the coupon is invalid, the status code will be 404 and the response will say why it is invalid. If the coupon is valid, the status code will be 200 and the coupon will be returned. The following reasons for invalidity are supported:

        + Coupon not found
        + Coupon is invalid
        + Coupon expired

        If you have more than one product family and if the coupon you are validating does not belong to the first product family in your site, then you will need to specify the product family, either in the url or as a query string param. This can be done by supplying the id or the handle in the `handle:my-family` format.

        Eg.

        ```
        https://<subdomain>.chargify.com/product_families/handle:<product_family_handle>/coupons/validate.<format>?code=<coupon_code>
        ```

        Or:

        ```

        This endpoint allows you to create and/or update currency prices for an existing coupon. Multiple prices can be created or updated in a single request but each of the currencies must be defined on the site level already and the coupon must be an amount-based coupon, not percentage.

        Currency pricing for coupons must mirror the setup of the primary coupon pricing - if the primary coupon is percentage based, you will not be able to define pricing in non-primary currencies.

        ## Coupon Subcodes Intro

        Coupon Subcodes allow you to create a set of unique codes that allow you to expand the use of one coupon.

        For example:

        Master Coupon Code:

        + SPRING2020

        Coupon Subcodes:

        + SPRING90210
        + DP80302
        + SPRINGBALTIMORE

        Coupon subcodes can be administered in the Admin Interface or via the API.

        When creating a coupon subcode, you must specify a coupon to attach it to using the coupon_id. Valid coupon subcodes are all capital letters, contain only letters and numbers, and do not have any spaces. Lowercase letters will be capitalized before the subcode is created.

        ## Coupon Subcodes Documentation

        Full documentation on how to create coupon subcodes in the Chargify UI can be located [here](https://chargify.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4407755909531#coupon-codes).

        Additionally, for documentation on how to apply a coupon to a Subscription within the Chargify UI, please see our documentation [here](https://chargify.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4407884887835#coupon).

        ## Create Coupon Subcode

        This request allows you to create specific subcodes underneath an existing coupon code.

        *Note*: If you are using any of the allowed special characters ("%", "@", "+", "-", "_", and "."), you must encode them for use in the URL.

            % to %25
            @ to %40
            + to %2B
            - to %2D
            _ to %5F
            . to %2E

        So, if the coupon subcode is `20%OFF`, the URL to delete this coupon subcode would be: `https://<subdomain>.chargify.com/coupons/567/codes/20%25OFF.<format>`

        ## Example

        Given a coupon with an ID of 567, and a coupon subcode of 20OFF, the URL to `DELETE` this coupon subcode would be:

        ```
        http://subdomain.chargify.com/coupons/567/codes/20OFF.<format>
        ```

        Note: If you are using any of the allowed special characters (“%”, “@”, “+”, “-”, “_”, and “.”), you must encode them for use in the URL.

        | Special character | Encoding |
        |-------------------|----------|
        | %                 | %25      |
        | @                 | %40      |
        | +                 | %2B      |
        | –                 | %2D      |
        | _                 | %5F      |
        | .                 | %2E      |

        ## Percent Encoding Example

        Or if the coupon subcode is 20%OFF, the URL to delete this coupon subcode would be: @https://<subdomain>.chargify.com/coupons/567/codes/20%25OFF.<format>

        ## Events Intro

        Chargify Events include various activity that happens around a Site. This information is **especially** useful to track down issues that arise when subscriptions are not created due to errors.

        Within the Chargify UI, "Events" are referred to as "Site Activity".  Full documentation on how to record view Events / Site Activty in the Chargify UI can be located [here](https://chargify.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4407864698139).

        ## List Events for a Site

        This method will retrieve a list of events for a site. Use query string filters to narrow down results. You may use the `key` filter as part of your query string to narrow down results.

        ### Legacy Filters

        The following keys are no longer supported.

        + `payment_failure_recreated`
        + `payment_success_recreated`
        + `renewal_failure_recreated`
        + `renewal_success_recreated`
        + `zferral_revenue_post_failure` - (Specific to the deprecated Zferral integration)
        + `zferral_revenue_post_success` - (Specific to the deprecated Zferral integration)

        ## Event Specific Data

        Event Specific Data

        Each event type has its own `event_specific_data` specified.

        Here’s an example event for the `subscription_product_change` event:

        ```
        {
            "event": {
                "id": 351,
                "key": "subscription_product_change",
                "message": "Product changed on Marky Mark's subscription from 'Basic' to 'Pro'",
                "subscription_id": 205,
                "event_specific_data": {
                    "new_product_id": 3,
                    "previous_product_id": 2
                },
                "created_at": "2012-01-30T10:43:31-05:00"
            }
        }
        ```

        Here’s an example event for the `subscription_state_change` event:

        ```
         {
             "event": {
                 "id": 353,
                 "key": "subscription_state_change",

                 "event_specific_data": {
                     "new_subscription_state": "active",
                     "previous_subscription_state": "trialing"
                 },
                 "created_at": "2012-01-30T10:43:33-05:00"

        This request will create a component definition under the specified product family. These component definitions determine what components are named, how they are measured, and how much they cost.

        Components can then be added and “allocated” for each subscription to a product in the product family. These component line-items affect how much a subscription will be charged, depending on the current allocations (i.e. 4 IP Addresses, or SSL “enabled”)

        This documentation covers both component definitions and component line-items. Please understand the difference.

        Please note that you may not edit components via API. To do so, please log into the application.

        Use this endpoint to read current price points that are associated with a component.

        You may specify the component by using either the numeric id or the `handle:gold` syntax.

        When fetching a component's price points, if you have defined multiple currencies at the site level, you can optionally pass the `?currency_prices=true` query param to include an array of currency price data in the response.

        If the price point is set to `use_site_exchange_rate: true`, it will return pricing based on the current exchange rate. If the flag is set to false, it will return all of the defined prices for each currency.

        When updating a price point, it's prices can be updated as well by creating new prices or editing / removing existing ones.

        Passing in a price bracket without an `id` will attempt to create a new price.

        Including an `id` will update the corresponding price, and including the `_destroy` flag set to true along with the `id` will remove that price.

        Note: Custom price points cannot be updated directly. They must be edited through the Subscription.

        This endpoint allows you to create currency prices for a given currency that has been defined on the site level in your settings.

        When creating currency prices, they need to mirror the structure of your primary pricing. For each price level defined on the component price point, there should be a matching price level created in the given currency.

        Note: Currency Prices are not able to be created for custom price points.

        This endpoint returns your site's MRR movements.

        ## Understanding MRR movements

        This endpoint will aid in accessing your site's [MRR Report](https://chargify.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4407838249627) data.

        Whenever a subscription event occurs that causes your site's MRR to change (such as a signup or upgrade), we record an MRR movement. These records are accessible via the MRR Movements endpoint.

        Each MRR Movement belongs to a subscription and contains a timestamp, category, and an amount. `line_items` represent the subscription's product configuration at the time of the movement.

        ### Plan & Usage Breakouts

        In the MRR Report UI, we support a setting to [include or exclude](https://chargify.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4407838249627#displaying-component-based-metered-usage-in-mrr) usage revenue. In the MRR APIs, responses include `plan` and `usage` breakouts.

        Plan includes revenue from:
        * Products
        * Quantity-Based Components
        * On/Off Components

        Usage includes revenue from:
        * Metered Components
        * Prepaid Usage Components

        This endpoint allows you to create currency prices for a given currency that has been defined on the site level in your settings.

        When creating currency prices, they need to mirror the structure of your primary pricing. If the product price point defines a trial and/or setup fee, each currency must also define a trial and/or setup fee.

        Note: Currency Prices are not able to be created for custom product price points.

        Use this endpoint to create a payment profile for a customer.

        Payment Profiles house the credit card, ACH (Authorize.Net or Stripe only,) or PayPal (Braintree only,) data for a customer. The payment information is attached to the customer within Chargify, as opposed to the Subscription itself.

        You must include a customer_id so that Chargify will attach it to the customer entry. If no customer_id is included the API will return a 404.

        ## Create a Payment Profile for ACH usage

        If you would like to create a payment method that is a Bank Account applicable for ACH payments use the following:
        ```json
        {
        "payment_profile": {
          "customer_id": [Valid-Customer-ID],
          "bank_name": "Best Bank",
          "bank_routing_number": "021000089",
          "bank_account_number": "111111111111",
          "bank_account_type": "checking",
          "bank_account_holder_type": "business",
          "payment_type": "bank_account"
          }
        }
        ```

        ## Taxable Subscriptions

        If your subscriber pays taxes on their purchased product, and you are attempting to create or update the `payment_profile`, complete address information is required. For information on required address formatting to allow your subscriber to be taxed, please see our documentation [here](https://developer.chargify.com/content/basics/signups.html#taxes)

        ## Payment Profile Documentation

        Full documentation on how Payment Profiles operate within Chargify can be located under the following links:

        ## Create a Payment Profile with a Chargify.js token

        ```json
        {
          "payment_profile": {
            "customer_id": 1036,
            "chargify_token": "tok_w68qcpnftyv53jk33jv6wk3w"
          }
        }
        ```

        ## Active Payment Methods

        Creating a new payment profile for a Customer via the API will not make that Payment Profile current for any of the Customer’s Subscriptions. In order to utilize the payment profile as the default, it must be set as the default payment profile for the subscription or subscription group.

        ## Requirements

        Either the full_number, expiration_month, and expiration_year or if you have an existing vault_token from your gateway, that vault_token and the current_vault are required.
        Passing in the vault_token and current_vault are only allowed when creating a new payment profile.

        ### Taxable Subscriptions

        If your subscriber pays taxes on their purchased product, and you are attempting to create or update the `payment_profile`, complete address information is required. For information on required address formatting to allow your subscriber to be taxed, please see our documentation [here](https://developer.chargify.com/content/basics/signups.html#taxes)

        ## BraintreeBlue
        Some merchants use Braintree JavaScript libraries directly and then pass `payment_method_nonce` and/or `paypal_email` to create a payment profile. This implementation is deprecated and does not handle 3D Secure.  Instead, we have provided [Chargify.js](https://developers.chargify.com/docs/developer-docs/ZG9jOjE0NjAzNDI0-overview) which is continuously improved and supports Credit Cards (along with 3D Secure), PayPal and ApplePay payment types.

        ### GoCardless with Local Bank Details

        Following examples create customer, bank account and mandate in GoCardless:

        ```json
        {
          "payment_profile": {
            "customer_id": "Valid-Customer-ID",
            "bank_name": "Royal Bank of France",
            "bank_account_number": "0000000",

            "billing_zip": "92700",
            "billing_country": "FR"
          }
        }
        ```

        ### GoCardless with IBAN

        ```json
        {

          }
        }
        ```

        ### Importing GoCardless

        If the customer, bank account, and mandate already exist in GoCardless, a payment profile can be created by using the IDs. In order to create masked versions of `bank_account_number` and `bank_routing_number` that are used to display within Chargify Admin UI, you can pass the last four digits for this fields which then will be saved in this form `XXXX[four-provided-digits]`.

        ```json
        {
          "payment_profile": {
            "customer_id": "24907598",
            "customer_vault_token": [Existing GoCardless Customer ID]
            "vault_token": [Existing GoCardless Mandate ID],
            "current_vault": "gocardless",
            "bank_name": "French Bank",
            "bank_account_number": [Last Four Of The Existing Account Number or IBAN if applicable],
            "bank_routing_number": [Last Four Of The Existing Routing Number],
            "payment_type": "bank_account",
            "billing_address": "20 Place de la Gare",
            "billing_city": "Colombes",
            "billing_state": "Île-de-France",

          }
        }
        ```

        ## 3D Secure - Checkout

        It may happen that a payment needs 3D Secure Authentication when the payment profile is created; this is referred to in our help docs as a [post-authentication flow](https://chargify.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4407754086811). The server returns `422 Unprocessable Entity` in this case with the following response:

        ```json
        {
            "jsonapi": {
                "version": "1.0"
            },
            "errors": [
                {
                    "title": "This card requires 3DSecure verification.",
                    "detail": "This card requires 3D secure authentication. Redirect the customer to the URL from the action_link attribute to authenticate. Attach callback_url param to this URL if you want to be notified about the result of 3D Secure authentication. Attach redirect_url param to this URL if you want to redirect a customer back to your page after 3D Secure authentication. Example: https://checkout-test.chargifypay.test/3d-secure/checkout/pay_uerzhsxd5uhkbodx5jhvkg6yeu?one_time_token_id=93&callback_url=http://localhost:4000&redirect_url=https://yourpage.com will do a POST request to https://localhost:4000 after credit card is authenticated and will redirect a customer to https://yourpage.com after 3DS authentication.",
                    "links": {
                        "action_link": "https://checkout-test.chargifypay.test/3d-secure/checkout/pay_uerzhsxd5uhkbodx5jhvkg6yeu?one_time_token_id=93"
                    }
                }
            ]
        }
        ```

        To let the customer go through 3D Secure Authentication, they need to be redirected to the URL specified in `action_link`.
        Optionally, you can specify `callback_url` parameter in the `action_link` URL if you’d like to be notified about the result of 3D Secure Authentication. The `callback_url` will return the following information:

        - whether the authentication was successful (`success`)
        - the payment profile ID (`payment_profile_id`)

        Lastly, you can also specify a `redirect_url` parameter within the `action_link` URL if you’d like to redirect a customer back to your site.

        It is not possible to use `action_link` in an iframe inside a custom application. You have to redirect the customer directly to the `action_link`, then, to be notified about the result, use `redirect_url` or `callback_url`.

        The final URL that you send a customer to complete 3D Secure may resemble the following, where the first half is the `action_link` and the second half contains a `redirect_url` and `callback_url`: `https://checkout-test.chargifypay.test/3d-secure/checkout/pay_uerzhsxd5uhkbodx5jhvkg6yeu?one_time_token_id=93&callback_url=http://localhost:4000&redirect_url=https://yourpage.com`

        ### Example Redirect Flow

        You may wish to redirect customers to different pages depending on whether their SCA was performed successfully. Here's an example flow to use as a reference:

        1. Create a payment profile via API; it requires 3DS
        2. You receive a `action_link` in the response.
        3. Use this `action_link` to, for example, connect with your internal resources or generate a session_id
        4. Include 1 of those attributes inside the `callback_url` and `redirect_url` to be aware which “session” this applies to
        5. Redirect the customer to the `action_link` with `callback_url` and `redirect_url` applied
        6. After the customer finishes 3DS authentication, we let you know the result by making a request to applied `callback_url`.
        7. After that, we redirect the customer to the `redirect_url`; at this point the result of authentication is known
        8. Optionally, you can use the applied "msg" param in the `redirect_url` to determine whether it was successful or not

        ## Partial Card Updates

        In the event that you are using the Authorize.net, Stripe, Cybersource, Forte or Braintree Blue payment gateways, you can update just the billing and contact information for a payment method. Note the lack of credit-card related data contained in the JSON payload.

        In this case, the following JSON is acceptable:

        ```
        {
          "payment_profile": {
            "first_name": "Kelly",
            "last_name": "Test",
            "billing_address": "789 Juniper Court",
            "billing_city": "Boulder",
            "billing_state": "CO",
            "billing_zip": "80302",
            "billing_country": "US",
            "billing_address_2": null
          }
        }
        ```

        The result will be that you have updated the billing information for the card, yet retained the original card number data.

        ## Specific notes on updating payment profiles

        - Merchants with **Authorize.net**, **Cybersource**, **Forte**, **Braintree Blue** or **Stripe** as their payment gateway can update their Customer’s credit cards without passing in the full credit card number and CVV.

        - If you are using **Authorize.net**, **Cybersource**, **Forte**, **Braintree Blue** or **Stripe**, Chargify will ignore the credit card number and CVV when processing an update via the API, and attempt a partial update instead. If you wish to change the card number on a payment profile, you will need to create a new payment profile for the given customer.

        - A Payment Profile cannot be updated with the attributes of another type of Payment Profile. For example, if the payment profile you are attempting to update is a credit card, you cannot pass in bank account attributes (like `bank_account_number`), and vice versa.

        - Updating a payment profile directly will not trigger an attempt to capture a past-due balance. If this is the intent, update the card details via the Subscription instead.

        - If you are using Authorize.net or Stripe, you may elect to manually trigger a retry for a past due subscription after a partial update.

        + If you delete the default payment profile for a subscription, you will need to specify another payment profile to be the default through the api, or either prompt the user to enter a card in the billing portal or on the self-service page, or visit the Payment Details tab on the subscription in the Admin UI and use the “Add New Credit Card” or “Make Active Payment Method” link, (depending on whether there are other cards present).

        This endpoint returns a list of invoice events. Each event contains event "data" (such as an applied payment) as well as a snapshot of the `invoice` at the time of event completion.

        Exposed event types are:

        + issue_invoice
        + apply_credit_note
        + apply_payment
        + refund_invoice
        + void_invoice

        + backport_invoice
        + change_invoice_status
        + change_invoice_collection_method
        + remove_payment

        Invoice events are returned in ascending order.

        If both a `since_date` and `since_id` are provided in request parameters, the `since_date` will be used.

        Note - invoice events that occurred prior to 09/05/2018 __will not__ contain an `invoice` snapshot.

        This API call should be used when you want to record an external payment against a specific invoice. If you would like to apply a payment across multiple invoices, you can use the Bulk Payment endpoint.

        ## Create a Payment from the Subscription's Prepayment Account

        In order apply a prepayment to an invoice, specify the `type` as `prepayment`, and also the `amount`.

        ```
        {
          "type": "prepayment",
          "payment": {
            "amount": 10.00
          }
        }
        ```

        Note that the `amount` must be less than or equal to the Subscription's Prepayment account balance.

        ## Create a Payment from the Subscription's Service Credit Account

        In order to apply a service credit to an invoice, specify the `type` as `service_credit`, and also the `amount`:


        ```
        {
          "type": "service_credit",
          "payment": {
            "amount": 10.00
          }
        }
        ```

        Note that Chargify will attempt to fully pay the invoice's `due_amount` from the Subscription's Service Credit account. At this time, partial payments from a Service Credit Account are only allowed for consolidated invoices (subscription groups). Therefore, for normal invoices the Service Credit account balance must be greater than or equal to the invoice's `due_amount`.

        Credit Notes are like inverse invoices. They reduce the amount a customer owes.

        By default, the credit notes returned by this endpoint will exclude the arrays of `line_items`, `discounts`, `taxes`, `applications`, or `refunds`. To include these arrays, pass the specific field as a key in the query with a value set to `true`.

        Record an external payment made against a subscription that will pay partially or in full one or more invoices.

        Payment will be applied starting with the oldest open invoice and then next oldest, and so on until the amount of the payment is fully consumed.

        Excess payment will result in the creation of a prepayment on the Invoice Account.

        Only ungrouped or primary subscriptions may be paid using the "bulk" payment request.

      description: |-
        This endpoint allows you to reopen any invoice with the "canceled" status. Invoices enter "canceled" status if they were open at the time the subscription was canceled (whether through dunning or an intentional cancellation).

        Invoices with "canceled" status are no longer considered to be due. Once reopened, they are considered due for payment. Payment may then be captured in one of the following ways:

        - Reactivating the subscription, which will capture all open invoices (See note below about automatic reopening of invoices.)
        - Recording a payment directly against the invoice

        A note about reactivations: any canceled invoices from the most recent active period are automatically opened as a part of the reactivation process. Reactivating via this endpoint prior to reactivation is only necessary when you wish to capture older invoices from previous periods during the reactivation.

        ### Reopening Consolidated Invoices

        When reopening a consolidated invoice, all of its canceled segments will also be reopened.

      description: "This endpoint creates a new allocation, setting the current allocated quantity for the Component and recording a memo.\n\n**Notice**: Allocations can only be updated for Quantity, On/Off, and Prepaid Components.\n\n## Allocations Documentation\n\nFull documentation on how to record Allocations in the Chargify UI can be located [here](https://chargify.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4407899119771). It is focused on how allocations operate within the Chargify UI. It goes into greater detail on how the user interface will react when recording allocations.\n\nThis documentation also goes into greater detail on how proration is taken into consideration when applying component allocations.\n\n## Proration Schemes\n\nChanging the allocated quantity of a component mid-period can result in either a Charge or Credit being applied to the subscription. When creating an allocation via the API, you can pass the `upgrade_charge`, `downgrade_credit`, and `accrue_charge` to be applied.\n\n**Notice:** These proration and accural fields will be ignored for Prepaid Components since this component type always generate charges immediately without proration.\n\nFor background information on prorated components and upgrade/downgrade schemes, see: API: [Setting Component Allocations.](https://chargify.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4407899119771). See the tables below for valid values.\n\n| upgrade_charge | Definition \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_|\n|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| `full` \_ \_ \_ \_ |\_A charge is added for the full price of the component. \_\_\_ \_ \_ \_ \_|\n| `prorated` \_ \_ |\_A charge is added for the prorated price of the component change. |\n| `none` \_ \_ \_ \_ |\_No charge is added. \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ |\n\n| downgrade_credit | Definition \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_|\n|------------------|---------------------------------------------------|\n| `full` \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ |\_A full price credit is added for the amount owed. |\n| `prorated` \_ \_ \_ |\_A prorated credit is added for the amount owed. \_ |\n| `none` \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ |\_No charge is added. \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ |\n\n| accrue_charge | Definition \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_   |\n|---------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| `true` \_ \_ \_ \_| Attempt to charge the customer at next renewal.                                                            |\n| `false` \_ \_ \_ |\_Attempt to charge the customer right away.\_If it fails, the charge will be accrued until the next renewal. |\n\n### Order of Resolution for upgrade_charge and downgrade_credit\n\n1. Per allocation in API call (within a single allocation of the `allocations` array)\n2. [Component-level default value](https://chargify.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4407755865883#moving-subscriptions-between-price-points)\n3. Allocation API call top level (outside of the `allocations` array)\n4. [Site-level default value](https://chargify.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4407899119771#proration-schemes)\n\n### Order of Resolution for accrue charge\n\n1. Allocation API call top level (outside of the `allocations` array)\n2. [Site-level default value](https://chargify.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4407899119771#proration-schemes)\n\n**NOTE: Proration uses the current price of the component as well as the current tax rates. Changes to either may cause the prorated charge/credit to be wrong.**"

        This endpoint returns the 50 most recent Allocations, ordered by most recent first.

        ## On/Off Components

        When a subscription's on/off component has been toggled to on (`1`) or off (`0`), usage will be logged in this response.

        ## Querying data via Chargify gem

        You can also query the current quantity via the [official Chargify Gem.](http://github.com/chargify/chargify_api_ares)

        ```# First way
        component = Chargify::Subscription::Component.find(1, :params => {:subscription_id => 7})
        puts component.allocated_quantity
        # => 23

        # Second way
        component = Chargify::Subscription.find(7).component(1)
        puts component.allocated_quantity
        # => 23
        ```

        Chargify offers the ability to preview a potential subscription's **quantity-based** or **on/off** component allocation in the middle of the current billing period.  This is useful if you want users to be able to see the effect of a component operation before actually doing it.

        ## Fine-grained Component Control: Use with multiple `upgrade_charge`s or `downgrade_credits`

        When the allocation uses multiple different types of `upgrade_charge`s or `downgrade_credit`s, the Allocation is viewed as an Allocation which uses "Fine-Grained Component Control". As a result, the response will not include `direction` and `proration` within the `allocation_preview` at the `line_items` and `allocations` level respectfully.

        See example below for Fine-Grained Component Control response.

        When the expiration interval options are selected on a prepaid usage component price point, all allocations will be created with an expiration date. This expiration date can be changed after the fact to allow for extending or shortening the allocation's active window.

        In order to change a prepaid usage allocation's expiration date, a PUT call must be made to the allocation's endpoint with a new expiration date.

        ## Limitations

        A few limitations exist when changing an allocation's expiration date:

        - An expiration date can only be changed for an allocation that belongs to a price point with expiration interval options explicitly set.
        - An expiration date can be changed towards the future with no limitations.
        - An expiration date can be changed towards the past (essentially expiring it) up to the subscription's current period beginning date.

        Prepaid Usage components are unique in that their allocations are always additive. In order to reduce a subscription's allocated quantity for a prepaid usage component each allocation must be destroyed individually via this endpoint.

        ## Credit Scheme

        By default, destroying an allocation will generate a service credit on the subscription. This behavior can be modified with the optional `credit_scheme` parameter on this endpoint. The accepted values are:

        1. `none`: The allocation will be destroyed and the balances will be updated but no service credit or refund will be created.
        2. `credit`: The allocation will be destroyed and the balances will be updated and a service credit will be generated. This is also the default behavior if the `credit_scheme` param is not passed.
        3. `refund`: The allocation will be destroyed and the balances will be updated and a refund will be issued along with a Credit Note.

        ## Documentation

        Full documentation on how to create Components in the Chargify UI can be located [here](https://chargify.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4407755865883). Additionally, for information on how to record component usage against a subscription, please see the following resources:

        + [Recording Metered Component Usage](https://chargify.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4407899119771#reporting-metered-component-usage)
        + [Reporting Prepaid Component Status](https://chargify.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4407899119771#reporting-prepaid-component-status)

        You may choose to report metered or prepaid usage to Chargify as often as you wish. You may report usage as it happens. You may also report usage periodically, such as each night or once per billing period. If usage events occur in your system very frequently (on the order of thousands of times an hour), it is best to accumulate usage into batches on your side, and then report those batches less frequently, such as daily. This will ensure you remain below any API throttling limits. If your use case requires higher rates of usage reporting, we recommend utilizing Events Based Components.

        ## Create Usage for Subscription

        This endpoint allows you to record an instance of metered or prepaid usage for a subscription. The `quantity` from usage for each component is accumulated to the `unit_balance` on the [Component Line Item](./b3A6MTQxMDgzNzQ-read-subscription-component) for the subscription.

        ## Price Point ID usage

        If you are using price points, for metered and prepaid usage components, Chargify gives you the option to specify a price point in your request.

        You do not need to specify a price point ID. If a price point is not included, the default price point for the component will be used when the usage is recorded.

        If an invalid `price_point_id` is submitted, the endpoint will return an error.

        ## Deducting Usage

        In the event that you need to reverse a previous usage report or otherwise deduct from the current usage balance, you may provide a negative quantity.

        Example:

        Previously recorded:

        ```json
        {
          "usage": {
            "quantity": 5000,
            "memo": "Recording 5000 units"
          }
        }
        ```

        At this point, `unit_balance` would be `5000`. To reduce the balance to `0`, POST the following payload:

        ```json
        {
          "usage": {
            "quantity": -5000,
            "memo": "Deducting 5000 units"
          }
        }
        ```

        The `unit_balance` has a floor of `0`; negative unit balances are never allowed. For example, if the usage balance is 100 and you deduct 200 units, the unit balance would then be `0`, not `-100`.

        ## FAQ

        Q. Is it possible to record metered usage for more than one component at a time?

        A. No. Usage should be reported as one API call per component on a single subscription. For example, to record that a subscriber has sent both an SMS Message and an Email, send an API call for each.

      description: |-
        This request will return a list of the usages associated with a subscription for a particular metered component. This will display the previously recorded components for a subscription.

        This endpoint is not compatible with quantity-based components.

        ## Since Date and Until Date Usage

        Note: The `since_date` and `until_date` attributes each default to midnight on the date specified. For example, in order to list usages for January 20th, you would need to append the following to the URL.

        ```
        ?since_date=2016-01-20&until_date=2016-01-21
        ```

        ## Read Usage by Handle

        Use this endpoint to read the previously recorded components for a subscription.  You can now specify either the component id (integer) or the component handle prefixed by "handle:" to specify the unique identifier for the component you are working with.

        In order to bill your subscribers on your Events data under the Events-Based Billing feature, the components must be activated for the subscriber.

        Learn more about the role of activation in the [Events-Based Billing docs](https://chargify.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4407720810907#activating-components-for-subscribers).

        Use this endpoint to activate an event-based component for a single subscription. Activating an event-based component causes Chargify to bill for events when the subscription is renewed.

        *Note: it is possible to stream events for a subscription at any time, regardless of component activation status. The activation status only determines if the subscription should be billed for event-based component usage at renewal.*

        Full documentation on how subscriptions operate within Chargify can be located under the following topics:

        + [Subscriptions Reference](https://chargify.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4407881092763)
        + [Subscriptions Actions](https://chargify.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4407895937819)
        + [Subscription Cancellation](https://chargify.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4407896775579)
        + [Subscription Reactivation](https://chargify.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4407898737691)
        + [Subscription Import](https://chargify.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4407896986779)

        When creating a subscription, you must specify a product and a customer. Credit card details may be required, depending on the options for the Product being subscribed ([see Product Options](https://chargify.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4407762386203)).

        The product may be specified by `product_id` or by `product_handle` (API Handle). In similar fashion, to pass a particular product price point, you may either use `product_price_point_handle` or `product_price_point_id`.

        An existing customer may be specified by a `customer_id` (ID within Chargify) or a `customer_reference` (unique value within your app that you have shared with Chargify via the reference attribute on a customer). You may also pass in an existing payment profile for that customer with `payment_profile_id`. A new customer may be created by providing `customer_attributes`.

        Credit card details may be required, depending on the options for the product being subscribed. The product can be specified by `product_id` or by `product_handle` (API Handle).

        If you are creating a subscription with a payment profile, the attribute to send will be `credit_card_attributes` or `bank_account_attributes` for ACH and Direct Debit. That said, when you read the subscription after creation, we return the profile details under `credit_card` or `bank_account`.

        ## Taxable Subscriptions

        If your intent is to charge your subscribers tax via [Avalara Taxes](https://chargify.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4407904217755) or [Custom Taxes](https://chargify.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4407911887771), there are a few considerations to be made regarding collecting subscription data. For subscribers to be eligible to be taxed, the following information for the `customer` object or `payment_profile` object must by supplied:

        + A subscription to a [taxable product](https://chargify.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4407762386203#tax-settings)
        + [Full valid billing or shipping address](https://chargify.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4407904217755#full-address-required-for-taxable-subscriptions) to identify the tax locale
        + The portion of the address that houses the [state information](https://chargify.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4407904217755#required-state-format-for-taxable-subscriptions) of either adddress must adhere to the ISO standard of a 2-3 character limit/format.
        The portion of the address that houses the [country information](https://chargify.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4407904217755#required-country-format-for-taxable-subscriptions) must adhere to the ISO standard of a 2 character limit/format.

        ## Subscription Request Examples

        The subscription examples below will be split into two sections.

        The first section, "Subscription Customization", will focus on passing different information with a subscription, such as components, calendar billing, and custom fields. These examples will presume you are using a secure `chargify_token` generated by Chargify.js.

        The second section, "Passing Payment Information", will focus on passing payment information into Chargify. Please be aware that <b>collecting and sending Chargify raw card details requires PCI compliance on your end</b>; these examples are provided as guidance. If your business is not PCI compliant, we recommend using Chargify.js to collect credit cards or bank accounts.

        # Subscription Customization

        ## With Components

        Different components require slightly different data. For example, quantity-based and on/off components accept `allocated_quantity`, while metered components accept `unit_balance`.

        When creating a subscription with a component, a `price_point_id` can be passed in along with the `component_id` to specify which price point to use. If not passed in, the default price point will be used.

        Note: if an invalid `price_point_id` is used, the subscription will still proceed but will use the component's default price point.

        Components and their price points may be added by ID or by handle. See the example request body labeled "Components By Handle (Quantity-Based)"; the format will be the same for other component types.

        ## With Coupon(s)

        Pass an array of `coupon_codes`. See the example request body "With Coupon".

        ## With Manual Invoice Collection

        The `invoice` collection method works only on legacy Statement Architecture.

        On Relationship Invoicing Architecture use the `remittance` collection method.

        ## Prepaid Subscription

        A prepaid subscription can be created with the usual subscription creation parameters, specifying `prepaid` as the `payment_collection_method` and including a nested `prepaid_subscription_configuration`.

        After a prepaid subscription has been created, additional funds can be manually added to the prepayment account through the [Create Prepayment Endpoint](./b3A6MTQxMDg0MTY-create-prepayment).

        Prepaid subscriptions do not work on legacy Statement Architecture.

        ## With Metafields

        Metafields can either attach to subscriptions or customers. Metafields are popuplated with the supplied metadata to the resource specified.

        If the metafield doesn't exist yet, it will be created on-the-fly.

        ## With Custom Pricing

        Custom pricing is pricing specific to the subscription in question.
        Create a subscription with custom pricing by passing pricing information instead of a price point.
        For a custom priced product, pass the custom_price object in place of `product_price_point_id`. For a custom priced component, pass the `custom_price` object within the component object.
        Custom prices and price points can exist in harmony on a subscription.

        # Passing Payment Information

        ## Subscription with Chargify.js token

        The `chargify_token` can be obtained using [chargify.js](https://developers.chargify.com/docs/developer-docs/ZG9jOjE0NjAzNDI0-overview). The token represents payment profile attributes that were provided by the customer in their browser and stored at the payment gateway.

        The `payment_type` attribute may either be `credit_card` or `bank_account`, depending on the type of payment method being added. If a bank account is being passed, the payment attributes should be changed to `bank_account_attributes`.

        ```json
        {
          "subscription": {
            "product_handle": "pro-plan",
            "customer_attributes": {
              "first_name": "Joe",
              "last_name": "Smith",
              "email": "j.smith@example.com"
            },
            "credit_card_attributes": {
              "chargify_token": "tok_cwhvpfcnbtgkd8nfkzf9dnjn",
              "payment_type": "credit_card"
            }
          }
        }
        ```

        ## Subscription with vault token

        If you already have a customer and card stored in your payment gateway, you may create a subscription with a `vault_token`.  Providing the last_four, card type and expiration date will allow the card to be displayed properly in the Chargify UI.

        ```json
        {
          "subscription": {
            "product_handle": "pro-plan",
            "customer_attributes": {
              "first_name": "Joe",
              "last_name": "Smith",
              "email": "j.smith@example.com"
            },
            "credit_card_attributes": {
              first_name: "Joe,
              last_name: "Smith",
              card_type: "visa",
              expiration_month: "05",
              expiration_year: "2025",
              last_four: "1234",
              vault_token: "12345abc",
              current_vault: "braintree_blue"
          }
        }
        ```

        ## 3D Secure - Stripe

        It may happen that a payment needs 3D Secure Authentication when the subscription is created; this is referred to in our help docs as a [post-authentication flow](https://chargify.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4407754086811). The server returns `422 Unprocessable Entity` in this case with the following response:

        ```json
        {
          "errors": [
            "Your card was declined. This transaction requires 3D secure authentication."
          ],
          "gateway_payment_id": "pi_1F0aGoJ2UDb3Q4av7zU3sHPh",
          "description": "This card requires 3D secure authentication. Redirect the customer to the URL from the action_link attribute to authenticate. Attach callback_url param to this URL if you want to be notified about the result of 3D Secure authentication. Attach redirect_url param to this URL if you want to redirect a customer back to your page after 3D Secure authentication. Example: https://mysite.chargify.com/3d-secure/pi_1FCm4RKDeye4C0XfbqquXRYm?one_time_token_id=128&callback_url=https://localhost:4000&redirect_url=https://yourpage.com will do a POST request to https://localhost:4000 after payment is authenticated and will redirect a customer to https://yourpage.com after 3DS authentication.",

        }
        ```

        To let the customer go through 3D Secure Authentication, they need to be redirected to the URL specified in `action_link`.
        Optionally, you can specify `callback_url` parameter in the `action_link` URL if you’d like to be notified about the result of 3D Secure Authentication. The `callback_url` will return the following information:

        - whether the authentication was successful (`success`)
        - the gateway ID for the payment (`gateway_payment_id`)
        - the subscription ID (`subscription_id`)

        Lastly, you can also specify a `redirect_url` within the `action_link` URL if you’d like to redirect a customer back to your site.

        It is not possible to use `action_link` in an iframe inside a custom application. You have to redirect the customer directly to the `action_link`, then, to be notified about the result, use `redirect_url` or `callback_url`.

        The final URL that you send a customer to to complete 3D Secure may resemble the following, where the first half is the `action_link` and the second half contains a `redirect_url` and `callback_url`: `https://mysite.chargify.com/3d-secure/pi_1FCm4RKDeye4C0XfbqquXRYm?one_time_token_id=128&callback_url=https://localhost:4000&redirect_url=https://yourpage.com`

        ## 3D Secure - Checkout

        It may happen that a payment needs 3D Secure Authentication when the subscription is created; this is referred to in our help docs as a [post-authentication flow](https://chargify.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4407754086811). The server returns `422 Unprocessable Entity` in this case with the following response:

        ```json
        {
          "errors": [
            "Your card was declined. This transaction requires 3D secure authentication."
          ],
          "gateway_payment_id": "pay_6gjofv7dlyrkpizlolsuspvtiu",
          "description": "This card requires 3D secure authentication. Redirect the customer to the URL from the action_link attribute to authenticate. Attach callback_url param to this URL if you want to be notified about the result of 3D Secure authentication. Attach redirect_url param to this URL if you want to redirect a customer back to your page after 3D Secure authentication. Example: https://mysite.chargify.com/3d-secure/pay_6gjofv7dlyrkpizlolsuspvtiu?one_time_token_id=123&callback_url=https://localhost:4000&redirect_url=https://yourpage.com will do a POST request to https://localhost:4000 after payment is authenticated and will redirect a customer to https://yourpage.com after 3DS authentication.",
          "action_link": "http://mysite.chargify.com/3d-secure/pay_6gjofv7dlyrkpizlolsuspvtiu?one_time_token_id=123"
        }
        ```

        - the gateway ID for the payment (`gateway_payment_id`)
        - the subscription ID (`subscription_id`)

        Lastly, you can also specify a `redirect_url` parameter within the `action_link` URL if you’d like to redirect a customer back to your site.

        ### Example Redirect Flow

        You may wish to redirect customers to different pages depending on whether their SCA was performed successfully. Here's an example flow to use as a reference:

        1. Create a subscription via API; it requires 3DS
        2. You receive a `gateway_payment_id` in the `action_link` along other params in the response.
        3. Use this `gateway_payment_id` to, for example, connect with your internal resources or generate a session_id
        4. Include 1 of those attributes inside the `callback_url` and `redirect_url` to be aware which “session” this applies to
        5. Redirect the customer to the `action_link` with `callback_url` and `redirect_url` applied
        6. After the customer finishes 3DS authentication, we let you know the result by making a request to applied `callback_url`.
        7. After that, we redirect the customer to the `redirect_url`; at this point the result of authentication is known
        8. Optionally, you can use the applied "msg" param in the `redirect_url` to determine whether it was successful or not

        ## Subscriptions Import

        Subscriptions can be “imported” via the API to handle the following scenarios:

        + You already have existing subscriptions with specific start and renewal dates that you would like to import to Chargify
        + You already have credit cards stored in your provider’s vault and you would like to create subscriptions using those tokens

        Before importing, you should have already set up your products to match your offerings. Then, you can create Subscriptions via the API just like you normally would, but using a few special attributes.

        Full documentation on how import Subscriptions using the **import tool** in the Chargify UI can be located [here](https://chargify.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4407896986779).

        ### Important Notices and Disclaimers regarding Imports

        Before performing a bulk import of subscriptions via the API, we suggest reading the [Subscriptions Import](https://chargify.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4407896986779#important-notices-and-disclaimers) instructions to understand the repurcussions of a large import.

        ### Subscription Input Attributes

        The following _additional_ attributes to the subscription input attributes make imports possible: `next_billing_at`, `previous_billing_at`, and `import_mrr`.

        ### Current Vault

        If you are using a Legacy gateway such as "eWAY Rapid (Legacy)" or "Stripe (Legacy)" then please contact Support for further instructions on subscription imports.

        ### Braintree Blue (Braintree v2) Imports

        Braintree Blue is Braintree’s newer (version 2) API. For this gateway, please provide the `vault_token` parameter with the value from Braintree’s “Customer ID” rather than the “Payment Profile Token”. At this time we do not use `current_vault_token` with the Braintree Blue gateway, and we only support a single payment profile per Braintree Customer.

        When importing PayPal type payment profiles, please set `payment_type` to `paypal_account`.

        ### Stripe ACH Imports

        If the bank account has already been verified, currently you will need to create the customer, create the payment profile in Chargify - setting verified=true, then create a subscription using the customer_id and payment_profile_id.

        ### Webhooks During Import

        If no `next_billing_at` is provided, webhooks will be fired as normal. If you do set a future `next_billing_at`, only a subset of the webhooks are fired when the subscription is created. Keep reading for more information as to what webhooks will be fired under which scenarios.

        #### Successful creation with Billing Date

        Scenario: If `next_billing_at` provided

        + `signup_success`
        + `billing_date_change`

        #### Successful creation without Billing Date

        Scenario: If no `next_billing_at` provided

        + `signup_success`
        + `payment_success`

        #### Unsuccessful creation

        Scenario: If card can’t be charged, and no `next_billing_at` provided

        + signup_failure

        #### Webhooks fired when next_billing_at is reached:

        + `renewal_success or renewal_failure`
        + `payment_success or payment_failure`

        ### Date and Time Formats

        We will attempt to parse any string you send as the value of next_billing_at in to a date or time. For best results, use a known format like described in “Date and Time Specification” of RFC 2822 or ISO 8601 .

        The following are all equivalent and will work as input to `next_billing_at`:

        ```
        Aug 06 2030 11:34:00 -0400
        Aug 06 2030 11:34 -0400
        2030-08-06T11:34:00-04:00
        8/6/2030 11:34:00 EDT
        8/6/2030 8:34:00 PDT
        2030-08-06T15:34:00Z
        ```
        You may also pass just a date, in which case we will assume the time to be noon

        ```
        2010-08-06
        ```

        ## Subscription Hierarchies & WhoPays

        When subscription groups were first added to our Relationship Invoicing architecture, to group together invoices for related subscriptions and allow for complex customer hierarchies and WhoPays scenarios, they were designed to consist of a primary and a collection of group members. The primary would control many aspects of the group, such as when the consolidated invoice is generated. As of today, groups still function this way.

        In the future, the concept of a "primary" will be removed in order to offer more flexibility into group management and reduce confusion concerning what actions must be done on a primary level, rather than a member level.

        We have introduced a two scheme system as a bridge between these two group organizations. Scheme 1, which is relevant to all subscription groups today, marks the group as being "ruled" by a primary.

        When reading a subscription via API, they will return a top-level attribute called `group`, which will denote which scheme is being used. At this time, the `scheme` attribute will always be 1.

        ### Subscription in a Customer Hierarchy

        For sites making use of the [Relationship Billing](https://chargify.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4407737494171) and [Customer Hierarchy] features, it is possible to create subscriptions within a customer hierarchy.  This can be achieved through the API by passing group parameters in the **Create Subscription** request.

        + The `group` parameters are optional and consist of the required `target` and optional `billing` parameters.

        When the `target` parameter specifies a customer that is already part of a hierarchy, the new subscription will become a member of the customer hierarchy as well.  If the target customer is not part of a hierarchy, a new customer hierarchy will be created and both the target customer and the new subscription will become part of the hierarchy with the specified target customer set as the responsible payer for the hierarchy's subscriptions.

        Rather than specifying a customer, the `target` parameter could instead simply have a value of `self` which indicates the subscription will be paid for not by some other customer, but by the subscribing customer.  This will be true whether the customer is being created new, is already part of a hierarchy, or already exists outside a hierarchy.  A valid payment method must also be specified in the subscription parameters.

        Note that when creating subscriptions in a customer hierarchy, if the customer hierarchy does not already have a payment method, passing valid credit card attributes in the subscription parameters will also result in the payment method being established as the default payment method for the customer hierarchy irrespective of the responsible payer.

        The optional `billing` parameters specify how some aspects of the billing for the new subscription should be handled.  Rather than capturing payment immediately, the `accrue` parameter can be included so that the new subscription charges accrue until the next assessment date.  Regarding the date, the `align_date` parameter can be included so that the billing date of the new subscription matches up with the default subscription group in the customer hierarchy.  When choosing to align the dates, the `prorate` parameter can also be specified so that the new subscription charges are prorated based on the billing period of the default subscription group in the customer hierarchy also.

        ### Subscription in a Subscription Group

        For sites making use of [Relationship Billing](https://chargify.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4407737494171) it may be desireable to create a subscription as part of a [subscription group](https://chargify.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4407746391835) in order to rely on [invoice consolidation](https://chargify.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4407746391835).  This can be achieved through the API by passing group parameters in the Create Subscription request.  The `group` parameters are optional and consist of the required `target` and optional `billing` parameters.

        The `target` parameters specify an existing subscription with which the newly created subscription should be grouped.  If the target subscription is already part of a group, the new subscription will become a member of the group as well.  If the target subscription is not part of a group, a new group will be created and both the target and the new subscription will become part of the group with the target as the group's primary subscription.

        The optional `billing` parameters specify how some aspects of the billing for the new subscription should be handled.  Rather than capturing payment immediately, the `accrue` parameter can be included so that the new subscription charges accrue until the next assessment date.  Regarding the date, the `align_date` parameter can be included so that the billing date of the new subscription matches up with the target subscription.  When choosing to align the dates, the `prorate` parameter can also be specified so that the new subscription charges are prorated based on the billing period of the target subscription also.

        ## Documentation

        Events-Based Billing is an evolved form of metered billing that is based on data-rich events streamed in real-time from your system to Chargify.

        These events can then be transformed, enriched, or analyzed to form the computed totals of usage charges billed to your customers.

        This API allows you to stream events into the Chargify data ingestion engine.

        Learn more about the feature in general in the [Events-Based Billing help docs](https://chargify.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4407720613403).

        ## Record Event

        Use this endpoint to record a single event.

        *Note: this endpoint differs from the standard Chargify endpoints in that the URL subdomain will be `events` and your site subdomain will be included in the URL path. For example:*

        ```
        https://events.chargify.com/my-site-subdomain/events/my-stream-api-handle
        ```

        Use this endpoint to record a collection of events.

        *Note: this endpoint differs from the standard Chargify endpoints in that the subdomain will be `events` and your site subdomain will be included in the URL path.*

        A maximum of 1000 events can be published in a single request. A 422 will be returned if this limit is exceeded.

        Create an offer within your Chargify site by sending a POST request.

        ## Documentation

        Offers allow you to package complicated combinations of products, components and coupons into a convenient package which can then be subscribed to just like products.

        Once an offer is defined it can be used as an alternative to the product when creating subscriptions.

        Full documentation on how to use offers in the Chargify UI can be located [here](https://chargify.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4407753852059).

        ## Using a Product Price Point

        You can optionally pass in a `product_price_point_id` that corresponds with the `product_id` and the offer will use that price point. If a `product_price_point_id` is not passed in, the product's default price point will be used.

        ## Modified Authentication Process

        The Sales Commission API differs from other Chargify API endpoints. This resource is associated with the seller itself. Up to now all available resources were at the level of the site, therefore creating the API Key per site was a sufficient solution. To share resources at the seller level, a new authentication method was introduced, which is user authentication. Creating an API Key for a user is a required step to correctly use the Sales Commission API, more details [here](https://developers.chargify.com/docs/developer-docs/ZG9jOjMyNzk5NTg0-2020-04-20-new-api-authentication).

        Access to the Sales Commission API endpoints is available to users with financial access, where the seller has the Advanced Analytics component enabled. For further information on getting access to Advanced Analytics please contact Chargify support.

        The subscription endpoint allows you to instantly update one or many attributes about a subscription in a single call.

        ## Update Subscription Payment Method

        Change the card that your Subscriber uses for their subscription. You can also use this method to simply change the expiration date of the card **if your gateway allows**.

        Note that partial card updates for **Authorize.Net** are not allowed via this endpoint. The existing Payment Profile must be directly updated instead.

        You also use this method to change the subscription to a different product by setting a new value for product_handle. A product change can be done in two different ways, **product change** or **delayed product change**.

        ## Product Change

        This endpoint may be used to change a subscription's product. The new payment amount is calculated and charged at the normal start of the next period. If you desire complex product changes or prorated upgrades and downgrades instead, please see the documentation on Migrating Subscription Products.

        To perform a product change, simply set either the `product_handle` or `product_id` attribute to that of a different product from the same site as the subscription. You can also change the price point by passing in either `product_price_point_id` or `product_price_point_handle` - otherwise the new product's default price point will be used.

        ### Delayed Product Change

        This method also changes the product and/or price point, and the new payment amount is calculated and charged at the normal start of the next period.

        This method schedules the product change to happen automatically at the subscription’s next renewal date. To perform a Delayed Product Change, set the `product_handle` attribute as you would in a regular product change, but also set the `product_change_delayed` attribute to `true`. No proration applies in this case.

        You can also perform a delayed change to the price point by passing in either `product_price_point_id` or `product_price_point_handle`

        **Note: To cancel a delayed product change, set `next_product_id` to an empty string.**

        ## Billing Date Changes

        ### Regular Billing Date Changes

        Send the `next_billing_at` to set the next billing date for the subscription. After that date passes and the subscription is processed, the following billing date will be set according to the subscription's product period.

        Note that if you pass an invalid date, we will automatically interpret and set the correct date. For example, when February 30 is entered, the next billing will be set to March 2nd in a non-leap year.

        The server response will not return data under the key/value pair of `next_billing`. Please view the key/value pair of `current_period_ends_at` to verify that the `next_billing` date has been changed successfully.

        ### Snap Day Changes

        For a subscription using Calendar Billing, setting the next billing date is a bit different. Send the `snap_day` attribute to change the calendar billing date for **a subscription using a product eligible for calendar billing**.

        Note: If you change the product associated with a subscription that contains a `snap_date` and immediately `READ/GET` the subscription data, it will still contain evidence of the existing `snap_date`. This is due to the fact that a product change is instantanous and only affects the product associated with a subscription. After the `next_billing` date arrives, the `snap_day` associated with the subscription will return to `null.` Another way of looking at this is that you willl have to wait for the next billing cycle to arrive before the `snap_date` will reset to `null`.

        Once a subscription has been paused / put on hold, you can update the date which was specified to automatically resume the subscription.

        To update a subscription's resume date, use this method to change or update the `automatically_resume_at` date.

        ### Remove the resume date

        Alternately, you can change the `automatically_resume_at` to `null` if you would like the subscription to not have a resume date.

        Chargify offers the ability to reactivate a previously canceled subscription. For details on how the reactivation works, and how to reactivate subscriptions through the application, see [reactivation](https://chargify.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4407898737691).

        **Please note: The term
        "resume" is used also during another process in Chargify. This occurs when an on-hold subscription is "resumed". This returns the subscription to an active state.**

        + The response returns the subscription object in the `active` or `trialing` state.
        + The `canceled_at` and `cancellation_message` fields do not have values.
        + The method works for "Canceled" or "Trial Ended" subscriptions.
        + It will not work for items not marked as "Canceled", "Unpaid", or "Trial Ended".

        ## Resume the current billing period for a subscription

        A subscription is considered "resumable" if you are attempting to reactivate within the billing period the subscription was canceled in.

        A resumed subscription's billing date remains the same as before it was canceled. In other words, it does not start a new billing period. Payment may or may not be collected for a resumed subscription, depending on whether or not the subscription had a balance when it was canceled (for example, if it was canceled because of dunning).

        Consider a subscription which was created on June 1st, and would renew on July 1st. The subscription is then canceled on June 15.

        If a reactivation with `resume: true` were attempted _before_ what would have been the next billing date of July 1st, then Chargify would resume the subscription.

        If a reactivation with `resume: true` were attempted _after_ what would have been the next billing date of July 1st, then Chargify would not resume the subscription, and instead it would be reactivated with a new billing period.

        | Canceled | Reactivation | Resumable? |
        |---|---|---|
        | Jun 15 | June 28 | Yes |
        | Jun 15 | July 2 | No |

        ## Reactivation Scenarios

        ### Reactivating Canceled Subscription While Preserving Balance

        + Given you have a product that costs $20
        + Given you have a canceled subscription to the $20 product
            + 1 charge should exist for $20
            + 1 payment should exist for $20
        + When the subscription has canceled due to dunning, it retained a negative balance of $20

        #### Results

        The resulting charges upon reactivation will be:
        + 1 charge for $20 for the new product
        + 1 charge for $20 for the balance due
        + Total charges = $40

        + The subscription will transition to active
        + The subscription balance will be zero

        ### Reactivating a Canceled Subscription With Coupon

        + Given you have a canceled subscription
        + It has no current period defined
        + You have a coupon code "EARLYBIRD"
        + The coupon is set to recur for 6 periods

        PUT request sent to:
        `https://acme.chargify.com/subscriptions/{subscription_id}/reactivate.json?coupon_code=EARLYBIRD`

        #### Results

        + The subscription will transition to active
        + The subscription should have applied a coupon with code "EARLYBIRD"

        ### Reactivating Canceled Subscription With a Trial, Without the include_trial Flag

        + Given you have a canceled subscription
        + The product associated with the subscription has a trial

        + PUT request to
        `https://acme.chargify.com/subscriptions/{subscription_id}/reactivate.json`


        #### Results
        + The subscription will transition to active

        ### Reactivating Canceled Subscription With Trial, With the include_trial Flag

        + Given you have a canceled subscription
        + The product associated with the subscription has a trial

        + Send a PUT request to `https://acme.chargify.com/subscriptions/{subscription_id}/reactivate.json?include_trial=1`


        #### Results

        + The subscription will transition to trialing

        ### Reactivating Trial Ended Subscription

        + Given you have a trial_ended subscription
        + Send a PUT request

        #### Results

        + The subscription will transition to active

        ### Reactivating a trial ended subscription, without the include_trial flag

        #### Results

        + The subscription will transition to active

        ### Resuming a Canceled Subscription

        + Given you have a `canceled` subscription and it is resumable
        + Send a PUT request to `https://acme.chargify.com/subscriptions/{subscription_id}/reactivate.json?resume=true`

        #### Results

        + The subscription will transition to active
        + The next billing date should not have changed

        ### Attempting to resume a subscription which is not resumable

        + Given you have a `canceled` subscription, and it is not resumable
        + Send a PUT request to `https://acme.chargify.com/subscriptions/{subscription_id}/reactivate.json?resume=true`

        #### Results

        + The subscription will transition to active, with a new billing period.

        ### Attempting to resume but not reactivate a subscription which is not resumable

        + Given you have a `canceled` subscription, and it is not resumable
        + Send a PUT request to `https://acme.chargify.com/subscriptions/{subscription_id}/reactivate.json?resume[require_resume]=true`
        + The response status should be "422 UNPROCESSABLE ENTITY"
        + The subscription should be canceled with the following response
        ```
          {
            "errors": ["Request was 'resume only', but this subscription cannot be resumed."]
          }
        ```

        #### Results

        + The subscription should remain `canceled`
        + The next billing date should not have changed

        ### Resuming Subscription Which Was Trialing

      description: |-
        In order to create a migration, you must pass the `product_id` or `product_handle` in the object when you send a POST request. You may also pass either a `product_price_point_id` or `product_price_point_handle` to choose which price point the subscription is moved to. If no price point identifier is passed the subscription will be moved to the products default price point. The response will be the updated subscription.

        ## Valid Subscriptions

        Subscriptions should be in the `active` or `trialing` state in order to be migrated.

        (For backwards compatibility reasons, it is possible to migrate a subscription that is in the `trial_ended` state via the API, however this is not recommended.  Since `trial_ended` is an end-of-life state, the subscription should be canceled, the product changed, and then the subscription can be reactivated.)

        ## Migrations Documentation

        Full documentation on how to record Migrations in the Chargify UI can be located [here](https://chargify.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4407898373531).

        ## Failed Migrations

        One of the most common ways that a migration can fail is when the attempt is made to migrate a subscription to it's current product. Please be aware of this issue!

        ## Migration 3D Secure - Stripe

        It may happen that a payment needs 3D Secure Authentication when the subscription is migrated to a new product; this is referred to in our help docs as a [post-authentication flow](https://chargify.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4407754086811). The server returns `422 Unprocessable Entity` in this case with the following response:

        ```json
        {
          "errors": [
            "Your card was declined. This transaction requires 3D secure authentication."
          ],
          "gateway_payment_id": "pi_1F0aGoJ2UDb3Q4av7zU3sHPh",
          "description": "This card requires 3D secure authentication. Redirect the customer to the URL from the action_link attribute to authenticate. Attach callback_url param to this URL if you want to be notified about the result of 3D Secure authentication. Attach redirect_url param to this URL if you want to redirect a customer back to your page after 3D Secure authentication. Example: https://mysite.chargify.com/3d-secure/pi_1FCm4RKDeye4C0XfbqquXRYm?one_time_token_id=128&callback_url=https://localhost:4000&redirect_url=https://yourpage.com will do a POST request to https://localhost:4000 after payment is authenticated and will redirect a customer to https://yourpage.com after 3DS authentication.",
          "action_link": "http://acme.chargify.com/3d-secure/pi_1F0aGoJ2UDb3Q4av7zU3sHPh?one_time_token_id=242"
        }
        ```

        To let the customer go through 3D Secure Authentication, they need to be redirected to the URL specified in `action_link`.
        Optionally, you can specify `callback_url` parameter in the `action_link` URL if you’d like to be notified about the result of 3D Secure Authentication. The `callback_url` will return the following information:

        - whether the authentication was successful (`success`)
        - the gateway ID for the payment (`gateway_payment_id`)
        - the subscription ID (`subscription_id`)

        Lastly, you can also specify a `redirect_url` within the `action_link` URL if you’d like to redirect a customer back to your site.

        It is not possible to use `action_link` in an iframe inside a custom application. You have to redirect the customer directly to the `action_link`, then, to be notified about the result, use `redirect_url` or `callback_url`.

        The final URL that you send a customer to to complete 3D Secure may resemble the following, where the first half is the `action_link` and the second half contains a `redirect_url` and `callback_url`: `https://mysite.chargify.com/3d-secure/pi_1FCm4RKDeye4C0XfbqquXRYm?one_time_token_id=128&callback_url=https://localhost:4000&redirect_url=https://yourpage.com`

        ### Example Redirect Flow

        You may wish to redirect customers to different pages depending on whether their SCA was performed successfully. Here's an example flow to use as a reference:

        1. Create a migration via API; it requires 3DS
        2. You receive a `gateway_payment_id` in the `action_link` along other params in the response.
        3. Use this `gateway_payment_id` to, for example, connect with your internal resources or generate a session_id
        4. Include 1 of those attributes inside the `callback_url` and `redirect_url` to be aware which “session” this applies to
        5. Redirect the customer to the `action_link` with `callback_url` and `redirect_url` applied
        6. After the customer finishes 3DS authentication, we let you know the result by making a request to applied `callback_url`.
        7. After that, we redirect the customer to the `redirect_url`; at this point the result of authentication is known
        8. Optionally, you can use the applied "msg" param in the `redirect_url` to determine whether it was successful or not.

        ## Previewing a future date
        It is also possible to preview the migration for a date in the future, as long as it's still within the subscription's current billing period, by passing a `proration_date` along with the request (eg: `"proration_date": "2020-12-18T18:25:43.511Z"`).

        This will calculate the prorated adjustment, charge, payment and credit applied values assuming the migration is done at that date in the future as opposed to right now.

        This API endpoint allows you to set certain subscription fields that are usually managed for you automatically. Some of the fields can be set via the normal Subscriptions Update API, but others can only be set using this endpoint.

        This endpoint is provided for cases where you need to “align” Chargify data with data that happened in your system, perhaps before you started using Chargify. For example, you may choose to import your historical subscription data, and would like the activation and cancellation dates in Chargify to match your existing historical dates. Chargify does not backfill historical events (i.e. from the Events API), but some static data can be changed via this API.

        Why are some fields only settable from this endpoint, and not the normal subscription create and update endpoints? Because we want users of this endpoint to be aware that these fields are usually managed by Chargify, and using this API means **you are stepping out on your own.**

        Changing these fields will not affect any other attributes. For example, adding an expiration date will not affect the next assessment date on the subscription.

        If you regularly need to override the current_period_starts_at for new subscriptions, this can also be accomplished by setting both `previous_billing_at` and `next_billing_at` at subscription creation. See the documentation on [Importing Subscriptions](./b3A6MTQxMDgzODg-create-subscription#subscriptions-import) for more information.

        ## Limitations

        When passing `current_period_starts_at` some validations are made:

        1. The subscription needs to be unbilled (no statements or invoices).
        2. The value passed must be a valid date/time. We recommend using the iso 8601 format.
        3. The value passed must be before the current date/time.

        If unpermitted parameters are sent, a 400 HTTP response is sent along with a string giving the reason for the problem.

        Chargify offers the ability to cancel a subscription at the end of the current billing period. This period is set by its current product.

        Requesting to cancel the subscription at the end of the period sets the `cancel_at_end_of_period` flag to true.

        Note that you cannot set `cancel_at_end_of_period` at subscription creation, or if the subscription is past due.

        Removing the delayed cancellation on a subscription will ensure that it doesn't get canceled at the end of the period that it is in. The request will reset the `cancel_at_end_of_period` flag to `false`.

        This endpoint is idempotent. If the subscription was not set to cancel in the future, removing the delayed cancellation has no effect and the call will be successful.

        The Chargify API allows you to preview a renewal by posting to the renewals endpoint. Renewal Preview is an object representing a subscription’s next assessment. You can retrieve it to see a snapshot of how much your customer will be charged on their next renewal.

        The "Next Billing" amount and "Next Billing" date are already represented in the UI on each Subscriber's Summary. For more information, please see our documentation [here](https://chargify.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4407884887835#next-billing).

        ## Optional Component Fields

        This endpoint is particularly useful due to the fact that it will return the computed billing amount for the base product and the components which are in use by a subscriber.

        By default, the preview will include billing details for all components _at their **current** quantities_. This means:

        * Current `allocated_quantity` for quantity-based components
        * Current enabled/disabled status for on/off components
        * Current metered usage `unit_balance` for metered components
        * Current metric quantity value for events recorded thus far for events-based components

        In the above statements, "current" means the quantity or value as of the call to the renewal preview endpoint. We do not predict end-of-period values for components, so metered or events-based usage may be less than it will eventually be at the end of the period.

        Optionally, **you may provide your own custom quantities** for any component to see a billing preview for non-current quantities. This is accomplished by sending a request body with data under the `components` key. See the request body documentation below.

        ## Subscription Side Effects

        You can request a `POST` to obtain this data from the endpoint without any side effects. Plain and simple, this will preview data, not log any changes against a subscription.

        This endpoint will allow you to create an ad hoc invoice.

        ### Basic Behavior

        You can create a basic invoice by sending an array of line items to this endpoint. Each line item, at a minimum, must include a title, a quantity and a unit price. Example:

        ```json
        {
          "invoice": {
            "line_items": [
              {
                "title": "A Product",
                "quantity": 12,
                "unit_price": "150.00"
              }
            ]
          }
        }
        ```

        ### Catalog items
        Instead of creating custom products like in above example, You can pass existing items like products, components.

        ```json
        {
          "invoice": {
            "line_items": [
              {
                "product_id": "handle:gold-product",
                "quantity": 2,
              }
            ]
          }
        }
        ```
         

        The price for each line item will be calculated as well as a total due amount for the invoice. Multiple line items can be sent.

        ### Line items types
        When defining line item, You can choose one of 3 types for one line item:
        #### Custom item
        Like in basic behavior example above, You can pass `title` and `unit_price` for custom item.
        #### Product id
        Product handle (with handle: prefix) or id from the scope of current subscription's site can be provided with `product_id`. By default `unit_price` is taken from product's default price point, but can be overwritten by passing `unit_price` or `product_price_point_id`. If `product_id` is used, following fields cannot be used: `title`, `component_id`.
        #### Component id
        Component handle (with handle: prefix) or id from the scope of current subscription's site can be provided with `component_id`. If `component_id` is used, following fields cannot be used: `title`, `product_id`. By default `unit_price` is taken from product's default price point, but can be overwritten by passing `unit_price` or `price_point_id`. At this moment price points are supportted only for quantity based, on/off and metered components. For prepaid and event based billing components `unit_price` is required.

        ### Coupons
        When creating ad hoc invoice discounts can be applied in following way:

        ```json
        {
          "invoice": {
            "line_items": [
              {
                "product_id": "handle:gold-product",
                "quantity": 1
              }
            ],
            "coupons": [ 
              {
                "code": "COUPONCODE",
                "percentage": 50.0
              }
            ]
          }
        }
        ```

        ### Coupon options
        #### Code
        Coupon `CODE` will be displayed on invoice discount section.
        Coupon code can only contain uppercase letters, numbers, and allowed special characters.
        Lowercase letters will be converted to uppercase.
        #### Percentage 
        Coupon `percentage` can take values from 0 to 100 and up to 4 decimal places. It cannot be used with `amount`. 
        #### Amount
        Coupon `amount` takes number value. It cannot be used with `percentage`. 
        #### Description
        Optional `description` will be displayed with coupon `CODE`

        ### Line Item Options

        #### Period Date Range

        A custom period date range can be defined for each line item with the `period_range_start` and `period_range_end` parameters. Dates must be sent in the `YYYY-MM-DD` format.
        `period_range_end` must be greater or equal `period_range_start`.

        #### Taxes

        The `taxable` parameter can be sent as `true` if taxes should be calculated for a specific line item. For this to work, the site should be configured to use and calculate taxes. Further, if the site uses Avalara for tax calculations, a `tax_code` parameter should also be sent. For existing catalog items: products/components taxes cannot be overwritten.

        #### Price Point
        Price point handle (with handle: prefix) or id from the scope of current subscription's site can be provided with `price_point_id` for components with `component_id` or `product_price_point_id` for products with `product_id` parameter. If price point is passed `unit_price` cannot be used. It can be used only with catalog items products and components.
         
        #### Description
        Optional `description` parameter, it will overwrite default generated description for line item.

        ### Invoice Options

        #### Issue Date

        By default, invoices will be created with a issue date set to today. `issue_date` parameter can be send to alter that. Only dates in the past can be send. `issue_date` should be send in `YYYY-MM-DD` format.

        #### Net Terms

        By default, invoices will be created with a due date matching the date of invoice creation. If a different due date is desired, the `net_terms` parameter can be sent indicating the number of days in advance the due date should be.

        #### Addresses

        The seller, shipping and billing addresses can be sent to override the site's defaults. Each address requires to send a `first_name` at a minimum in order to work. Please see below for the details on which parameters can be sent for each address object.

        #### Memo and Payment Instructions

        A custom memo can be sent with the `memo` parameter to override the site's default. Likewise, custom payment instructions can be sent with the `payment_instrucions` parameter.

        #### Status

        By default, invoices will be created with open status. Possible alternative is `draft`.

        ## Create Prepayment

        In order to specify a prepayment made against a subcription, specify the `amount, memo, details, method`.

        When the `method` specified is `"credit_card_on_file"`, the prepayment amount will be collected using the default credit card payment profile and applied to the prepayment account balance.  This is especially useful for manual replenishment of prepaid subscriptions.

        Please note that you **can't** pass `amount_in_cents`.

        Use this endpoint to update subscription group members.
        `"member_ids": []` should contain an array of both subscription IDs to set as group members and subscription IDs already present in the groups. Not including them will result in removing them from subscription group. To clean up members, just leave the array empty.

      operationId: post-subscription_groups-subscription_group_uid-reactivate.json
      description: |-
        This endpoint will attempt to reactivate or resume a cancelled subscription group. Upon reactivation, any canceled invoices created after the beginning of the primary subscription's billing period will be reopened and payment will be attempted on them. If the subscription group is being reactivated (as opposed to resumed), new charges will also be assessed for the new billing period.

        Whether a subscription group is reactivated (a new billing period is created) or resumed (the current billing period is respected) will depend on the parameters that are sent with the request as well as the date of the request relative to the primary subscription's period.

        ## Reactivating within the current period

        If a subscription group is cancelled and reactivated within the primary subscription's current period, we can choose to either start a new billing period or maintain the existing one. If we want to maintain the existing billing period the `resume=true` option must be passed in request parameters.

        An exception to the above are subscriptions that are on calendar billing. These subscriptions cannot be reactivated within the current period. If the `resume=true` option is not passed the request will return an error.

        The `resume_members` option is ignored in this case. All eligible group members will be automatically resumed.


        ## Reactivating beyond the current period

        In this case, a subscription group can only be reactivated with a new billing period. If the `resume=true` option is passed it will be ignored.

        Member subscriptions can have billing periods that are longer than the primary (e.g. a monthly primary with annual group members). If the primary subscription in a group cannot be reactivated within the current period, but other group members can be, passing `resume_members=true` will resume the existing billing period for eligible group members. The primary subscription will begin a new billing period.

        For calendar billing subscriptions, the new billing period created will be a partial one, spanning from the date of reactivation to the next corresponding calendar renewal date.

        For sites in test mode, you may purge individual subscriptions.

        Provide the subscription ID in the url.  To confirm, supply the customer ID in the query string `ack` parameter. You may also delete the customer record and/or payment profiles by passing `cascade` parameters. For example, to delete just the customer record, the query params would be: `?ack={customer_id}&cascade[]=customer`

        If you need to remove subscriptions from a live site, please contact support to discuss your use case.

        For sites making use of the [Relationship Billing](https://chargify.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4407737494171) and [Customer Hierarchy](https://chargify.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4407746683291) features, it is possible to add existing subscriptions to subscription groups.

        Passing `group` parameters with a `target` containing a `type` and optional `id` is all that's needed. When the `target` parameter specifies a `"customer"` or `"subscription"` that is already part of a hierarchy, the subscription will become a member of the customer's subscription group.  If the target customer or subscription is not part of a subscription group, a new group will be created and the subscription will become part of the group with the specified target customer set as the responsible payer for the group's subscriptions.

        Rather than specifying a customer, the `target` parameter could instead simply have a value of
        * `"self"` which indicates the subscription will be paid for not by some other customer, but by the subscribing customer,
        * `"parent"` which indicates the subscription will be paid for by the subscribing customer's parent within a customer hierarchy, or
        * `"eldest"` which indicates the subscription will be paid for by the root-level customer in the subscribing customer's hierarchy.

        The optional `billing` parameters specify how some aspects of the billing for the new subscription should be handled.  Rather than capturing payment immediately, the `accrue` parameter can be included so that the new subscription charges accrue until the next assessment date.  Regarding the date, the `align_date` parameter can be included so that the billing date of the new subscription matches up with the default subscription group in the customer hierarchy.  When choosing to align the dates, the `prorate` parameter can also be specified so that the new subscription charges are prorated based on the billing period of the default subscription group in the customer hierarchy also.

        The Chargify API allows you to preview a subscription by POSTing the same JSON or XML as for a subscription creation.

        The "Next Billing" amount and "Next Billing" date are represented in each Subscriber's Summary. For more information, please see our documentation [here](https://chargify.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4407884887835#next-billing).

        ## Side effects

        A subscription will not be created by sending a POST to this endpoint. It is meant to serve as a prediction.

        ## Taxable Subscriptions

        This endpoint will preview taxes applicable to a purchase. In order for taxes to be previewed, the following conditions must be met:

        + Taxes must be configured on the subscription
        + The preview must be for the purchase of a taxable product or component, or combination of the two.
        + The subscription payload must contain a full billing or shipping address in order to calculate tax

        For more information about creating taxable previews, please see our documentation guide on how to create [taxable subscriptions.](https://chargify.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4407904217755#creating-taxable-subscriptions)

        You do **not** need to include a card number to generate tax information when you are previewing a subscription. However, please note that when you actually want to create the subscription, you must include the credit card information if you want the billing address to be stored in Chargify. The billing address and the credit card information are stored together within the payment profile object. Also, you may not send a billing address to Chargify without payment profile information, as the address is stored on the card.

        ## Non-taxable Subscriptions

        If you'd like to calculate subscriptions that do not include tax, please feel free to leave off the billing information.

      description: |-
        This endpoint will trigger the creation of a consolidated proforma invoice asynchronously. It will return a 201 with no message, or a 422 with any errors. To find and view the new consolidated proforma invoice, you may poll the subscription group listing for proforma invoices; only one consolidated proforma invoice may be created per group at a time.

        If the information becomes outdated, simply void the old consolidated proforma invoice and generate a new one.

        ## Restrictions

        Proforma invoices are only available on Relationship Invoicing sites. To create a proforma invoice, the subscription must not be prepaid, and must be in a live state.

        ## Query Parameters vs Request Body Parameters

        Passing in a coupon code as a query parameter will add the code to the subscription, completely replacing all existing coupon codes on the subscription.

        For this reason, using this query parameter on this endpoint has been deprecated in favor of using the request body parameters as described below. When passing in request body parameters, the list of coupon codes will simply be added to any existing list of codes on the subscription.

        Return a preview of the data that will be included on a given subscription's proforma invoice if one were to be generated. It will have similar line items and totals as a renewal preview, but the response will be presented in the format of a proforma invoice. Consequently it will include additional information such as the name and addresses that will appear on the proforma invoice.

        The preview endpoint is subject to all the same conditions as the proforma invoice endpoint. For example, previews are only available on the Relationship Invoicing architecture, and previews cannot be made for end-of-life subscriptions.

        If all the data returned in the preview is as expected, you may then create a static proforma invoice and send it to your customer. The data within a preview will not be saved and will not be accessible after the call is made.

        Alternatively, if you have some proforma invoices already, you may make a preview call to determine whether any billing information for the subscription's upcoming renewal has changed.

        This endpoint allows for invoices to be programmatically delivered via email. This endpoint supports the delivery of both ad-hoc and automatically generated invoices. Additionally, this endpoint supports email delivery to direct recipients, carbon-copy (cc) recipients, and blind carbon-copy (bcc) recipients.

        Please note that if no recipient email addresses are specified in the request, then the subscription's default email configuration will be used. For example, if `recipient_emails` is left blank, then the invoice will be delivered to the subscription's customer email address.

        On success, a 204 no-content response will be returned. Please note that this does not indicate that email(s) have been delivered, but instead indicates that emails have been successfully queued for delivery. If _any_ invalid or malformed email address is found in the request body, the entire request will be rejected and a 422 response will be returned.

        One Time Tokens aka Chargify Tokens house the credit card or ACH (Authorize.Net or Stripe only) data for a customer.

        You can use One Time Tokens while creating a subscription or payment profile instead of passing all bank account or credit card data directly to a given API endpoint.

        To obtain a One Time Token you have to use [chargify.js](https://developers.chargify.com/docs/developer-docs/ZG9jOjE0NjAzNDI0-overview).

        This endpoint creates a new Segment for a Component with segmented Metric. It allows you to specify properties to bill upon and prices for each Segment. You can only pass as many "property_values" as the related Metric has segmenting properties defined.

        You may specify component and/or price point by using either the numeric ID or the `handle:gold` syntax.

        This endpoint allows you to create multiple segments in one request. The array of segments can contain up to `2000` records.

        If any of the records contain an error the whole request would fail and none of the requested segments get created. The error response contains a message for only the one segment that failed validation, with the corresponding index in the array.

        You may specify component and/or price point by using either the numeric ID or the `handle:gold` syntax.

        Generate an invoice in advance for a subscription's next renewal date. [Please see our docs](reference/Chargify-API.v1.yaml/components/schemas/Invoice) for more information on advance invoices, including eligibility on generating one; for the most part, they function like any other invoice, except they are issued early and have special behavior upon being voided.
        A subscription may only have one advance invoice per billing period. Attempting to issue an advance invoice when one already exists will return an error.
        That said, regeneration of the invoice may be forced with the params `force: true`, which will void an advance invoice if one exists and generate a new one. If no advance invoice exists, a new one will be generated.
        We recommend using either the create or preview endpoints for proforma invoices to preview this advance invoice before using this endpoint to generate it.

        Void a subscription's existing advance invoice. Once voided, it can later be regenerated if desired.
        A `reason` is required in order to void, and the invoice must have an open status. Voiding will cause any prepayments and credits that were applied to the invoice to be returned to the subscription. For a full overview of the impact of voiding, please [see our help docs](reference/Chargify-API.v1.yaml/components/schemas/Invoice).

        This endpoint allows you to issue an invoice that is in "pending" status. For example, you can issue an invoice that was created when allocating new quantity on a component and using "accrue charges" option.

        You cannot issue a pending child invoice that was created for a member subscription in a group.

        For Remittance subscriptions, the invoice will go into "open" status and payment won't be attempted. The value for `on_failed_payment` would be rejected if sent. Any prepayments or service credits that exist on subscription will be automatically applied. Additionally, if setting is on, an email will be sent for issued invoice.

        For Automatic subscriptions, prepayments and service credits will apply to the invoice and before payment is attempted. On successful payment, the invoice will go into "paid" status and email will be sent to the customer (if setting applies). When payment fails, the next event depends on the `on_failed_payment` value:
        - `leave_open_invoice` - prepayments and credits applied to invoice; invoice status set to "open"; email sent to the customer for the issued invoice (if setting applies); payment failure recorded in the invoice history. This is the default option.
        - `rollback_to_pending` - prepayments and credits not applied; invoice remains in "pending" status; no email sent to the customer; payment failure recorded in the invoice history.
        - `initiate_dunning` - prepayments and credits applied to the invoice; invoice status set to "open"; email sent to the customer for the issued invoice (if setting applies); payment failure recorded in the invoice history; subscription will  most likely go into "past_due" or "canceled" state (depending upon net terms and dunning settings).

      description: |
        Chargify offers the ability to activate awaiting signup and trialing subscriptions. This feature is only available on the Relationship Invoicing architecture. Subscriptions in a group may not be activated immediately.

        For details on how the activation works, and how to activate subscriptions through the application, see [activation](#).

        The `revert_on_failure` parameter controls the behavior upon activation failure. 
        - If set to `true` and something goes wrong i.e. payment fails, then Chargify will not change the subscription's state. The subscription’s billing period will also remain the same. 
        - If set to `false` and something goes wrong i.e. payment fails, then Chargify will continue through with the activation and enter an end of life state. For trialing subscriptions, that will either be trial ended (if the trial is no obligation), past due (if the trial has an obligation), or canceled (if the site has no dunning strategy, or has a strategy that says to cancel immediately). For awaiting signup subscriptions, that will always be canceled.

        The default activation failure behavior can be configured per activation attempt, or you may set a default value under Config > Settings > Subscription Activation Settings. 

        ## Activation Scenarios

        ### Activate Awaiting Signup subscription

        - Given you have a product without trial
        - Given you have a site without dunning strategy

        ```mermaid
          flowchart LR
            AS[Awaiting Signup] --> A{Activate}
            A -->|Success| Active
            A -->|Failure| ROF{revert_on_failure}
            ROF -->|true| AS
            ROF -->|false| Canceled
        ```

        - Given you have a product with trial
        - Given you have a site with dunning strategy

        ```mermaid
          flowchart LR
            AS[Awaiting Signup] --> A{Activate}
            A -->|Success| Trialing
            A -->|Failure| ROF{revert_on_failure}
            ROF -->|true| AS
            ROF -->|false| PD[Past Due]
        ```

        ### Activate Trialing subscription

        You can read more about the behavior of trialing subscriptions [here](https://maxio-chargify.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/5404494617357#trialing-subscriptions-0-0).
        When the `revert_on_failure` parameter is set to `true`, the subscription's state will remain as Trialing, we will void the invoice from activation and return any prepayments and credits applied to the invoice back to the subscription.

        This endpoint is only available for Relationship Invoicing sites. It cannot be used to create consolidated proforma invoices or preview prepaid subscriptions.

        Create a proforma invoice to preview costs before a subscription's signup. Like other proforma invoices, it can be emailed to the customer, voided, and publicly viewed on the chargifypay domain.

        Pass a payload that resembles a subscription create or signup preview request. For example, you can specify components, coupons/a referral, offers, custom pricing, and an existing customer or payment profile to populate a shipping or billing address.

        A product and customer first name, last name, and email are the minimum requirements. We recommend associating the proforma invoice with a customer_id to easily find their proforma invoices, since the subscription_id will always be blank.

        This endpoint is only available for Relationship Invoicing sites. It cannot be used to create consolidated proforma invoice previews or preview prepaid subscriptions.

        Create a signup preview in the format of a proforma invoice to preview costs before a subscription's signup. You have the option of optionally previewing the first renewal's costs as well. The proforma invoice preview will not be persisted.

        Pass a payload that resembles a subscription create or signup preview request. For example, you can specify components, coupons/a referral, offers, custom pricing, and an existing customer or payment profile to populate a shipping or billing address.

        A product and customer first name, last name, and email are the minimum requirements.

                  The value is approximated in cases where rounding errors make it difficult to apportion exactly a total tax among many lines. Several lines may have been summed prior to applying the tax rate to arrive at `tax_amount` for the invoice - backing that out to the tax on a single line may introduce rounding or precision errors.
              total_amount:
                type: string
                description: |-
                  The non-canonical total amount for the line.

                  `subtotal_amount` is the canonical amount for a line. The invoice `total_amount` is derived from the sum of the line `subtotal_amount`s and discounts or taxes applied thereafter.  Therefore, due to rounding or precision errors, the sum of line `total_amount`s may not equal the invoice `total_amount`.

                  * For periodic charges paid in arrears (e.g. metered charges), this date will be the date of the previous billing, and the end date will be the current billing date.
                  * For non-periodic charges, this date and the end date will match.

                  * For periodic charges paid in arrears (e.g. metered charges), this date will be the date of the current billing date.
